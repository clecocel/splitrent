# SplitRent
The easy way to assign prices to rooms

## How it works
Select the number of rooms to assign, select the total rent and start bidding!

### Pricing

When you bid on a room, you choose to increase its price by $10 to get it. This in turn reduces the prices for all the other rooms. You do this sequentially until everybody is happy with their room choice.
